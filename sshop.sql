Empires fight on a massive scale where soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist when thousands of players align in this game that challenges the skill and grit through intense land, air and vehicle gameplay. \r\n\r\nAcross four huge maps, players come together in enormous battles to win control of critical territories and key resources for their Empire. With an extensive skill tree and free-form class-based system, players customize their soldier, weapons and vehicles to match their play-style, as well as the needs of their squad, outfit or Empire. The world of PlanetSide 2 is massive and persistent with every soldier capable of making a difference.\r\nKey Features:\r\nTHREE WARING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three unique Empires – the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic, the rebellious, freedom-fighter faction New Conglomerate, or the technocratic, alien-influenced Empire Vanu Sovereignty. Each Empire has access to unique weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.\r\nMASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of troops, but hundreds; with air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of troops. Each battleground holds valuable resources and key positions, and the Empire that can conquer (and manage to hold) these territories are rewarded with tech bonuses, greater access to equipment, and more. \r\nENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space; every inch of which is hand-crafted, contestable space. Whether in open fields, tightly-packed urban centers or enormous outposts, victory requires calculated teamwork and a quick trigger finger to survive the massive battles.\r\nPERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions, such as power plants and ammo depots, has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle and provide key rewards and bonuses. \r\nCLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match their play-style, as well as the needs of their squad, outfit or Empire. With six distinct classes to explore, each combat role, vehicle and weapon has extensive skill trees that will allow players to grow characters laterally, unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, equipment, specialized skills, vehicles, and more. Play as one of six distinct classes: \r\n\r\n-	Heavy Assault – Rush into the battle ahead, guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.\r\n-	Light Assault – Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade and surprise your foes!\r\n-	Combat Medic – Keep your fellow soldiers healed- it’s your job to revive fallen comrades.\r\n-	Infiltrator – Stealthy and silent, you are death from the shadows. Whether you choose a knife from behind or a single shot from sniper’s nest, you are the enemy’s greatest fear.\r\n-	Engineer – A crucial support class with the ability to repair important gear including vehicles, terminals, and turrets. Engineers can drop their own shielded turret and mow down advancing troops.\r\n-	MAX – Heavily armored, cannons for hands, and a disposition to match, you are the ruler of the battlefield and a walking mass of armored death.\r\n\r\nOUTFIT TEAMWORK: Outfits play a very important role in each and every battle. From a small group of specialized soldiers or rapid response team, to a huge clan that can field multiple platoons of hundreds of players, outfits have access to unique customizations– allowing them to create their own identity and manage their reputation and overall role in the ongoing war.\r\nVEHICLES & WEAPONS: Players are able to access a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized for player preference or purposed with unique attachments and add-ons earned in game to fit each player’s style. \r\nPLAY FOR FREE: PlanetSide 2 is Free-To-Play with an additional in-game RMT marketplace with items that range from cosmetic camouflage patterns and armor paint jobs, to XP accelerators.

Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. \r\n\r\nSURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT\r\nStart off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life. Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. \r\n\r\nTRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS \r\nFind safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.\r\n\r\nPLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS\r\nPlayers can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets, work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods, or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION \r\nNether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character. There is a huge selection of cosmetic items and player taunts to assert your individuality along with entire outfits to play roles like survivalist, soldier and biker - or even just play in your underwear.\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\nHost your own private servers and control your settings and player population\r\nFirst-person perspective creates a true survival experience\r\nMeld of PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) gameplay\r\nNew weapons and items become available as players explore the game world\r\nUp to 64 players per game server\r\nSingle purchase, downloadable client allows full game access without subscription', 693000, 9.7, 'Games\\RPG\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014_Banner.jpg??Games\\RPG\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014(1).jpg??Games\\RPG\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014(2).jpg??Games\\RPG\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014\\NETHER RESURRECTED 2014(3).jpg??//www.youtube.com/embed/7-YJTQwvgJQ'),

Use your skills and cunning to kill, tame, mate and ride dinosaurs and primitive creatures living on the Ark, teaming with hundreds of players to survive, dominate and escape! \r\n\r\nThe following functions are present in the game as soon as it is released. We have many other aspects and improvements planned for the long-term development roadmap, and here\'s what you\'ll experience right now in ARK: \r\n\r\nLEARN, TRAIN, REPRODUCE AND RIDE DINOSAURS IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\n\r\nDinosaurs, creatures, & breeding! More than 50 species at the beginning of the anticipated access and more than 100 expected for the final exit - They can be tamed using a complex capture & affinity process, involving the weakening of a wild creature by knocking it out for she is unconscious and look after her with proper nutrition. Once tamed, you can give orders to your pet, who can follow them according to how you tamed and trained them. These pets, who can continue to gain in level and consume food, can also carry inventory and wear equipment such as armor, carry prey to your base according to their strength and larger ones can be mounted and controlled! A pterodactyl to fly over snow-capped mountains, raise allies on enemy walls, race through the jungle with a group of raptors, emerge in an enemy base using a gigantic Brontosaurus or hunt prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Participate in a dynamic ecosystem life cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchy, where you are just a creature among the many species that struggle for dominance and survival. Pets can also connect with the opposite sex, selectively replicating successive generations, using a character system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes the basics of hatching eggs and gestation life cycles in mammals! Or more simply,\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\n\r\nYou must drink and eat to survive, with many kinds of plants and meats having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your base and inventory is a critical concern. Any physical action has a cost in food and water, long journeys are at the risk of your resources! The weight of your inventory slows you down, and the day / night cycle as well as the unpredictable weather adds a layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, forcing you to hunt or water more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and make a wide variety of custom clothing and armor,\r\n\r\nHARVESTING, BUILDING STRUCTURES, PAINTING OBJECTS\r\n\r\nBy cutting down tree-filled forests and extracting metal and other precious resources, you can build parts to build massive multilevel structures made up of plug-in complex parts, such as ramps, beams, pillars, windows , doors, gates (large doors), remotely accessible doors, hatches, water pipes, faucets, generators, cables and all kinds of electrical appliances and ladders among so many other types of construction. Structures tend to collapse if enough supports (pillars and foundation) have been destroyed, so strengthening them is important. All structures and objects can be painted to change the look of your home, but also dynamically place signs that can be painted by pixel, billboard as well as other decorative objects. Shelters reduce the effects of extreme weather conditions and ensure your safety and the safety of the things you hide there. Weapons, clothes, armor can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nPLANT, GROW AND GROW \r\n\r\nChoose wild seeds around you, plant them in a plot you have installed, water them and feed them with fertilizer (anything defecates after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizers are better than others). Pay attention to your plantations and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can be used to cook a multitude of recipes and make tonics very useful! Explore and find the rarest seeds with the most powerful properties! Vegetarians and vegans can be delighted, it will be possible to conquer ARK in a nonviolent way! \r\n\r\nINVOKE THE GREATEST SPECIES\r\n\r\nBy bringing enough sacrifice items to a special summoning slot, you can catch the attention of one of the divine mystical creatures of ARK who will come to confront you. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an objective for groups of experienced players and their army of dinos, and will give objects of great value if they are defeated. \r\n\r\nTRIBE SYSTEM \r\n\r\nForm a tribe and invite your friends, all your dinosaurs can be commanded and allied to all those who are part of the tribe. Your tribe will be able to resurrect on any point of appearance of your bases. Promote your membership to the rank of tribal admin to reduce the burden of management. Distribute keys and password to provide access to your shared village!\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS \r\n\r\nAll objects are made from plans that have varying statistics and qualities, and require the corresponding resources. The most difficult and remote locations of KRG tend to provide you with better resources, including the highest mountains, the darkest cellars, and the depths of the ocean! \r\nIncrease your character\'s level by gaining experience with high-performing actions, increase the level of your dinos, and learn new \"Engrams\" so that you can build new memory objects without having to use even shots. if you die! Change the physical appearance of your character by changing the hair, eyes, skin color,\r\n\r\nHARDCORE GAME MECHANICS \r\n\r\nEverything you make has durability and will be re-rigged after heavy use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains asleep in the evergreen world. Your physical inventory exists in boxes on your character in the world. Everything can be picked up or stolen, so for security reasons you will have to build, recruit, or have dinos to monitor your hiding place. Death is permanent, and you even stun, capture, and force other players to consume food for your own sake, such as extracting blood for transfusions, collecting feces for use as fertilizer, or use as food for your carnivorous dinosaurs! \r\n\r\nEXPLORE AND DISCOVER\r\n\r\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of several natural and supernatural structures, above and below the earth, and under water. By fully exploring these secrets you will find the most exotic creatures and the rarest shots. Explorer notes can also be found, which are dynamically updated in the game by previous KRG residents over the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and background of the KRG and its creatures. Expand your map in-game by exploring, placing points of interest, and building a compass or GPS to help you explore with other players, with whom you can communicate via proximity chat and voice chat, or by long distance radio. Build and draw signs in play for other players to help or mislead them ... or even. How do you want to face the creators and conquer ARK.\r\n\r\nA HUGE PERSISTENT WORLD AND A META-UNIVERSE \r\n\r\nOn servers with more than 100 players, your character, all your builds and your animals, stays in the game even when you leave it. You can even physically move your character and items on the ARK network by accessing obelisks and uploading your data to (or from) Steam. A galaxy, all different from each other, where to leave a mark of your passage and conquer, one at a time - The special official Ark will be unveiled on the world map for a limited time in a unique event offering limited items in time ! \r\n\r\nSECURE MODS SUPPORT VIA WORKSHOP STEAM\r\n\r\nYou can play alone locally, and import your character and items to an unofficial server hosted by another player, ie move from a solo world to a multi mode. Modify the game, with full support from Steam Workshop and the Unreal Engine Editor 4. Look at how we built ARK using maps and assets as an example.
